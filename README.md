This PHP Calculator project showcases an object-oriented approach to performing basic arithmetic operations using a class and constructor. 
The Calculator class is designed to encapsulate the functionality of a calculator, allowing users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.


**Key Features:-**


**Object-Oriented Design:** The calculator is implemented as a class, promoting code reusability and organization. 
It uses a constructor to initialize the operands, ensuring that every instance of the calculator has the necessary values to perform calculations.


**Encapsulation:** The properties of the class (the numbers to be calculated) are kept private, which protects them from direct access outside the class.
This design enforces the use of methods for any operations on these properties.

**Basic Arithmetic Operations:** The class provides methods for each arithmetic operation.
Users can easily call these methods after creating an instance of the Calculator class with their desired numbers.

**User-Friendly Interface:** The project can be extended with a web interface (using HTML and Bootstrap) to allow users to input numbers and select operations through a form, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with coding.
